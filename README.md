### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there. I am Vu Truong - a tech-savvy individual, entrepreneur, and father of â€¦. children - who is on a mission to revolutionize the way people learn and share knowledge. I was born and raised in Vietnam, a country famous for gorgeous places and mouthwatering food. 
Having an in-depth understanding of the information technology, I believe that there is a better way to retain what you have learned. An innovative, result-oriented way where you are valued and your learning capacity is increased. I am passionate about it, and my primary aim is to offer out-of-the box solutions to the students and experts so that they can take their learning journey up a notch.
